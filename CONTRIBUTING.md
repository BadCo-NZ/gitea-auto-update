# Contributing

Thank you for your interest to contribute to this repository.

All good contributions which add a new feature or close a issue will be accepted, however there a few guidelines which should be followed:

1. Commit messages should follow the Angular Commit Message Format: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit
2. New features should be added with a new function, if a new function is possible.
3. Test-driven development (TDD) should be followed - this means you should always create unit tests for your function before you create the corresponding function.
